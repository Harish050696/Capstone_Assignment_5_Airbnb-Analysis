**Capstone 5 Airbnb Analysis**

The project revolves around analyzing Airbnb listing data to gain insights into pricing strategies, availability trends, and demand variations over time. The data is processed, visualized, and exported to a CSV file for external use in Power BI. Key focus areas include understanding price variation by location, property type, and room type, as well as visualizing how availability fluctuates throughout the year. Various charts (bar, line, and stacked) are utilized to make sense of the data and provide a visual interpretation.
